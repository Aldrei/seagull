This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

## Commit Message Convention

  - Type: This describes the purpose or nature of the commit. Common types include:

  feat: A new feature or enhancement.
  fix: A bug fix.
  docs: Documentation changes.
  chore: Routine tasks, maintenance, or tooling changes.
  style: Code style and formatting improvements (no code change).
  refactor: Code refactoring without changing functionality.
  test: Adding or modifying tests.
  perf: Performance improvements.
  build: Changes related to the build process or dependencies.

  - Scope (Optional): This indicates the part of the codebase that the commit affects. It's often project-specific and can be omitted if not applicable. Ex. (properties), (auth), (filter), etc...

    - Use imperative mood for the subject (e.g., "Fix bug" instead of "Fixed bug").

  - Subject: A concise and descriptive summary of the change. It should be written in the imperative mood (e.g., "Add feature" instead of "Added feature").

  - Example

    - fix(auth): check life time token
