## Commit Message Convention

- Type: This describes the purpose or nature of the commit. Common types include:

```bash
  feat: A new feature or enhancement.
  fix: A bug fix.
  docs: Documentation changes.
  chore: Routine tasks, maintenance, or tooling changes.
  style: Code style and formatting improvements (no code change).
  refactor: Code refactoring without changing functionality.
  test: Adding or modifying tests.
  perf: Performance improvements.
  build: Changes related to the build process or dependencies.
```

- Scope (Optional): This indicates the part of the codebase that the commit affects. It's often project-specific and can be omitted if not applicable. Ex. (properties), (auth), (filter), etc...

  - Use imperative mood for the subject (e.g., "Fix bug" instead of "Fixed bug").

- Subject: A concise and descriptive summary of the change. It should be written in the imperative mood (e.g., "Add feature" instead of "Added feature").

- Example

  - fix(auth): check life time token
